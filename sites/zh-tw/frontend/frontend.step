### 目標

我們的目標是要讓你熟悉 HTML、CSS 及 JavaScript，這些是構成網路體驗最重要的基礎。
接下來你會建立一個關於你的基本靜態網頁，並可以部署到網路上。你將會：

* write some content and give it some structure with **HTML**;
* use **CSS** to adjust the layout and style of that content;
* use **JavaScript** to add interactive components;
* optionally, push your website to GitHub with **git**.

Here's a sample sketch of what your page could look like:

### Schedule

* 1-2 hours of playing with basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* 4-ish hours of building our page.
* Optional: if you've worked with GitHub before and want to put your website online using Git and GitHub, we have instructions for that! (The curriculum has you keeping your site on your machine by default.)

This is just a rough guideline, not a mandate. Some steps you'll go over and some you'll go under. It'll all work out by the end of the day. :D

### Requirements

We're going to be working with:

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
  (If you're experienced with the developer tools in another browser, that may work too.);
* The code editor of your choice.
    * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is popular with many Ruby and Rails users. You can use it free for evaluation, then must pay to continue using it.
    * [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a free, open-source editor that can be customized with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A download is available for OS X 10.8+, Windows 7/8, and Ubuntu/RedHat linux.

Optional tools if you're deploying to GitHub:

* Git;
* Your [GitHub](http://github.com) account.
